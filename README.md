# Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the project, which includes an Express server with TypeScript and a React client with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Node.js installed on your machine

## Server Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lineus7/authentication-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the server directory:

```bash
cd server
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Fill server environment variables (create a .env file if not already present) with required configurations.

5. Start the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Client Setup

Open a new terminal window.

1. Navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Fill .env file in the client directory with required configurations.

4. Run the client application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Additional Notes

Ensure that the ports specified for the server and client applications do not conflict.

Make sure you have configured the environment variables properly both for the server and the client.
